# Will-a-Customer-Accept-the-Coupon? #

#### Overview: ####

In this first practical application assignment of the program, you will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not. Use the Practical Application Jupyter Notebook

#### Data: ####

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

#### Investigation Results and Conclusions ####


### Objetive: ###

The objective of this study is to analyze the probability of a customer accepting a promotional coupon while driving. Customer behavior in different contexts will be analyzed to determine if depending on the type of passengers carried affects the decision to accept or not a coupon. 

### Analysis: ###

The data will be carefully analyzed to identify the factors that significantly influence the decision to accept a coupon while driving depending on the type of passenger. Plots and calculations using the Pandas library will be used to estimate the probability of coupon acceptance as a function of the variables.

### Development: ###
